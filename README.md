# React Tic Tac Toe

React project built with Vite to follow React's official Tic-Tac-Toe [tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe).

You can clone this repository and run `npm run dev` to try it locally.

## Current state

Tutorial is finished. The application lets the user play the classic Tic-Tac-Toe with alternating turns (with an indicator), a winner indicator and a history of moves that can be used to travel between turns in a time machine fashion.

## Next up

I plan to tackle the objectives listed on the tutorials final section [Wrapping Up](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe#wrapping-up). That is:

- [ ] For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button.
- [ ] Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- [ ] Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- [ ] When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw).
- [ ] Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.

Also, I intend to give the application a little styling.
